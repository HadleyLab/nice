# Active Development Context

## Current Focus
- Finalizing documentation alignment
- Port configuration standardization
- UI state management optimizations

## Recent Changes
- Migrated from Tailwind to native NiceGUI color system
- Implemented configuration model/YAML synchronization
- Added dropdown-based color selector

## Immediate Next Steps
1. Implement port conflict resolution pattern
2. Add error boundary handling for async tasks
3. Develop configuration version migration system

## Key Decisions
- Using NiceGUI's native color props over CSS classes
- Strict Pydantic model/YAML field alignment
- Isolated builder pattern for UI components
