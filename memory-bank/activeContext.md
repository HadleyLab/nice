# Current Focus

## Recent Changes
- Removed Pydantic dependency
- Transitioned to native NiceGUI components
- Simplified builder architecture
- Leveraged built-in state management
  - Requires dictionary initialization: `ui.state({'key': value})`
  - Avoid tuple unpacking pattern: `state, setter = ui.state(0.0)`
  - Fixed progress tracking using direct dictionary access
  - Resolved 'float' binding error by using proper state objects
- Using native validation workflow

## Next Steps
- Implement NiceGUI infrastructure patterns for reactive elements
- Document state binding best practices
- Update button builders to use native event system
- Implement progress persistence

## Active Decisions
1. Using dictionary-based state for complex objects
2. Preferring NiceGUI's native reactivity over custom solutions
3. Maintaining minimal abstraction layers
4. Prioritizing type hints and runtime validation
